Release Notes:


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Release: CCL Version 1.7.5
  Date: April 24, 2007
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrected a problem with Database request number adjustment.
Changed V1 & V2 LOS requests to request extended responses if they are
converted to V3.
Changed the CigiHotReqV2 constructor to correctly set the request type to HOT
instead of HAT.
Corrected V3 & V3.2 SOF to correctly unpack the timestamp value.
Removed the SetReqTyp member function from CigiHatHotXRespV3 & V3_2, because V3
and V3.2 does not have that parameter in the packet.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Release: CCL Version 1.7.4
  Date: December 6, 2006
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrects a bug with the Version Jump Table that was causing a memory leak.
Corrected the way V3 Celestial Control and Atmosphere Control flags were
being set by the V1 and V2 Environmental Control classes.
Corrected a bug in CigiOutgoingMsg that now correctly zeros out the
Host database id request under specific conditions.


 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Release: CCL Version 1.7.3
  Date: August 11, 2006
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corrects a bug with IG Control and SOF that may have put the wrong
Minor Version number in the CIGI messages.  Corrected the CigiIGCtrlV3_2
and the CigiSOFV3_2 packing routines so that the Minor Version number is
is packed from the packing object (a CigiIGCtrlV3_2 or CigiSOFV3_2 object
when the current outgoing Cigi Version is 3.2) not the object with the 
user filled data.  This will put the correct Minor Version number in the 
Cigi message.




 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Release: CCL Version 1.7.2
  Date: July 18, 2006
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CCL is a C++ language library for implementing CIGI in both host and IG 
applications. Version 1.7.2 Corrects several problems with the way the CCL
has been recently released for Unix/Linux.  The CCL will now be released in
the .zip format for windows and the .tar.gz format for Unix/Linux.  Several
problems in CigiIncomingMsg involving setting the current CIGI version
were corrected.  The problem with the way the IterationVersion is initialized
and used in the iteration method of incoming message processing was corrected.
In the examples, several errors in the networking code involving a stray
pointer due to a #define were corrected.  Also in the examples,
a few errors involving the STL differences between MS6 and MS7 and
detecting the compiler version were corrected.
