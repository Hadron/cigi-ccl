Comment:
 The files in this directory do not include an explicit copyright
 statement or license.  I consider them subject to the blanket license
 (LGPL-2.1+) from the COPYING file at the top of the release
 directory, and based on the license statement taken from
 http://cigi.sourceforge.net/product_ccl.php ("The CCL is open source
 and licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)").  I
 have also contacted the upstream maintainer with a request to update
 the copyright information for these files to make the license more
 explicit.
