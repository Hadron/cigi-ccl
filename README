This is the source distribution of the CIGI Class Library (CCL).  This library 
makes integration of CIGI into an application much easier.  More information 
about CIGI and the CCL can be found on the CIGI web site: 
	http://cigi.sourceforge.net


INSTALLATION
============

Windows systems
---------------

The CCL can be compiled as a DLL or as a static LIB.  The project files for 
compiling as a DLL can be found in the ccl_dll directory, and project files 
for compiling as a LIB can be found in the ccl_lib directory.

UNIX systems
------------

UNIX installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.

Briefly, the process goes like this:
	./configure
	make

And run the following as 'root':
	make install


USAGE
=====

API Documentation
-----------------

Documentation for the CCL API is available from the CIGI web site, and in the 
form of Doxygen-generated help files.

pkg-config
----------

If you are building a program that uses the CIGI Class Library, and you are 
using a modern UNIX-like system, you may be able to take advantage of the 
'pkg-config' utility.  The CCL includes a configuration file for pkg-config, 
and this file is installed by default when you run 'make install'.  If your 
system has pkg-config installed, you can build CCL programs using a series of 
commands similar to the following:

cc `pkg-config --cflags cigicl` ...etc...
cc `pkg-config --libs cigicl` *.o ...etc...

This makes your Makefiles much more readable, and saves you time spent 
tracking down the location of header and library files.  You can get more info 
on pkg-config by running 'man pkg-config'.
