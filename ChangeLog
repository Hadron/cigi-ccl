Version 2.0.0
-------------
[03.11.2008]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Changed the method of conversion.
- Removed the Version Jump Table.
- Added the symbology packets.
- Changed the examples.
- Added Testing programs.


Version 1.7.5
-------------
[04.25.2007]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Corrected a problem with Database request number adjustment.
  Changed V1 & V2 LOS requests to request extended responses if they are
  converted to V3.
  Changed the CigiHotReqV2 constructor to correctly set the request type to HOT
  instead of HAT.
  Corrected V3 & V3.2 SOF to correctly unpack the timestamp value.
  Removed the SetReqTyp member function from CigiHatHotXRespV3 & V3_2, because
  V3 and V3.2 does not have that parameter in the packet.




Version 1.7.4
-------------
[12.06.2006]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Corrects a bug with the Version Jump Table that was causing a memory leak.
  Corrected the way V3 Celestial Control and Atmosphere Control flags were
  being set by the V1 and V2 Environmental Control classes.
  Corrected a bug in CigiOutgoingMsg that now correctly zeros out the
  Host database id request under specific conditions.



Version 1.7.3
-------------
[08.11.2006]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Corrects a bug with IG Control and SOF that may have put the wrong
  Minor Version number in the CIGI messages.  Corrected the CigiIGCtrlV3_2
  and the CigiSOFV3_2 packing routines so that the Minor Version number is
  is packed from the packing object (a CigiIGCtrlV3_2 or CigiSOFV3_2 object
  when the current outgoing Cigi Version is 3.2) not the object with the
  user filled data.  This will put the correct Minor Version number in the
  Cigi message.




Version 1.7.2
-------------
[07.18.2006]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Corrects several problems with the way the CCL has been recently released
  for Unix/Linux.  The CCL will now be released in the .zip format for
  windows and the .tar.gz format for Unix/Linux.

- Corrects several problems in CigiIncomingMsg involving setting the current
  CIGI version were corrected.  Also, corrects the problem with the way the
  IterationVersion is initialized and used in the iteration method of
  incoming message processing.

- In the examples, several errors in the networking code involving a stray
  pointer due to a #define were corrected.  Also in the examples,
  a few errors involving the STL differences between MS6 and MS7 and
  detecting the compiler version were corrected.



Version 1.7.1
-------------
[06.23.2006]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Defined new CIGI types Cigi_int8 and Cigi_uint8.

- Replaced use of native char and unsigned char types to use Cigi_int8 and
  Cigi_uint8 instead, to account for systems where char and unsigned char types
  are not 1 byte in size.


Version 1.7.0
-------------
[04.14.2006]

Changes/Additions:
------------------

- Added compatibility with CIGI version 3.2.

- Introduced minor version numbers to the library to handle packet translations
  for CIGI version 3.2.


Version 1.6.0
-------------

  PackageMsg(), FreeMsg(), and GetCurrentlyPackagedMsg().

- Modified the CigiMessage class to include a PackagedMsg member variable in
  support of automatic frame counter synchronization.

- Updated the CigiDummyIG example to use the new frame counter synchrnoization
  methods.

- Added the NewCigiMiniHost example to show usage of the new message
  synchronization calls.

-------------
[08.12.2005]

Bug Fixes:
------------------

  pointer to the correct SOF and IG Control handling objects.


Version 1.5.4
-------------
[07.05.2005]

Bug Fixes:
------------------

- Detects a buffer overrun error condition when processing the incoming message

  types instead of native types.

- Fixed the GetFirstPacket function in the CigiIncomingMsg class to use the
  correct start of frame and IG control opcode values.

- Fixed an error in the RegisterUserPacket function in the CigiVersionJumpTable
  class to properly handle user-defined packets when translating between
  different versions of CIGI.
